            &nbsp; In a not so distant future, where overpopulation and famine have forced governments to undertake 
            a drastic One-Child Policy, seven identical sisters (all of them portrayed by Noomi Rapace)<br> 
            live a hide-and-seek existence pursued by the Child Allocation Bureau. The Bureau, directed by 
            the fierce Nicolette Cayman (Glenn Close), enforces a strict family-planning agenda that the 
            sisters<br> outwit by taking turns assuming the identity of one person: Karen Settman.Taught by their 
            grandfather (Willem Dafoe) who raised and named them - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, 
            Saturday and Sunday -<br> each can go outside once a week as their common identity, but are only free to 
            be themselves in the prison of their own apartment.<br> That is until, one day, Monday does not come home.

            &nbsp; Simba and Nala have a daughter, Kiara. Timon and Pumbaa are assigned to be her babysitters, but 
            she easily escapes their care and ventures into the forbidden lands.<br> There she meets a lion cub 
            named Kovu and they become friends. What she and her parents do not know is that Kovu is the son 
            of Zira - a banished follower of the now-dead Scar.<br> She plans to raise Kovu to overthrow Simba 
            and become the king of the Pride Lands. This tests not only Kiara and Kovu's relationship as they 
            mature, but Simba's relationship with his daughter.<br>

            &nbsp; Craig and his cousin Day-Day have finally gotten jobs as mall security guards and moved into 
            their own crib. When a fake evil Santa Claus robs their rundown apartment<br> on Christmas Eve, 
            they embark on a comical adventure in an effort to track down the bandit and retrieve their 
            stolen loot. Meanwhile Day-Day's rent-a-cop tactics cause them<br> to continually miss their chance 
            to catch Santa Claus and instead has them squaring off against innocent caroling ladies, shady 
            neighborhood kids and the police.
